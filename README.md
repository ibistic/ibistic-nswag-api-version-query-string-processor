## Documentation

Ibistic.Public.NSwag.Extensions has by now one new api version processor.

### ApiVersionQueryStringProcessor

The api version processor from NSwag (NSwagProcessors.ApiVersionProcessor) only works when the versioning strategy used is based on the uri, i.e. /api/1.0/helloworld.

ApiVersionQueryStringProcessor has been built to query string versioning, which is the default versioning mode in Web API 2, i.e. /api/helloworld?api-version=1.0.

The way to use it is just to specify the new processor when the Open API specification is gonna be created. There are several ways to create that specification, by command line would be:

nswag webapi2openapi 
/operationprocessors:Ibistic.Public.NSwag.Extensions:Ibistic.Public.NSwag.Extensions.ApiVersionQueryStringProcessor
/referencepaths:MyNugetAssemblyPath
/assembly:MyWebAPI.dll
/output:OpenApiDocument.OpenApi.json
/outputtype:openapi3"

where MyNugetAssemblyPath is the folder where Ibistic.Public.NSwag.Extensions has been installed.

Remember to decorate your controllers and/or actions with the [ApiVersion] attribute.

``` csharp
    [ApiVersion("1.0")]
    [RoutePrefix("api/helloworld")]
    public sealed class HelloWorldController : ApiController
```

This is the result once the specificacion is created (used Redoc to render it).
